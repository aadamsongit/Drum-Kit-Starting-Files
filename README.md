# Drum-Kit-Starting-Files

// This is another project from The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp. The instructor gave tutorials for most of the code in this project, though
I was able to solve many of the JavaScript challenges independently. Changing the text color to white was a challenge that could be reversed, but I kept it
intact because I thought it was neat. (I did this line differently than the demo, but looked up some code that did what I want. As we all know, there are
many ways to find solutions in code.) I take no credit for the starting files as prepared and coded by Angela -- a wonderful instructor she is.
